        <h2>Souls games</h2>
<img src="download (2).jpeg" height="300" width="300">
<p>Souls refers to the games Demon Souls, Dark Souls I, II, and III, and Bloodborne. These games are all made by From Software. The category sometimes includes From Software's other games Sekiro and Elden Ring, though personally I prefer the more descriptive term "FromSoft games"</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Third">
<h2>Soulslike games</h2>
<img src="download (3).jpeg" height="300" width="300">
<p>"Soulslike" refers to any game that is similar to or inspired by the Souls games, regardless of publisher. Usually this means it's an action game that is challenging in a way that focuses on player skill, and doesn't involve a lot of randomness or grinding.</p>
