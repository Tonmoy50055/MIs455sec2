            A souls game is an action game, usually arpg.

            <br>Theyre very challenging mechanically but fair once you take the time to study your enemies and the environments. Some feel the challenge is excessive. Largely... it is. The first souls games were made by a dev who felt games were becoming too easy and made a challenging game that he wanted to play. Theyre very much not for everyone.
            
            When youre defeated in a souls game, you leave something behind- typically your money and or experience towards next level (in the og souls they were the same currency), but losing max hp or magic power is common too. If you can make it back from the checkpoint without dying again you can recover lost things. Die again and you may lose them forever.
            
            Enviornment wise a souls game has a lot of looping paths that allow one to open shortcuts, aiding that "get back to where you died" grind, as well as occasionally letting one crisscross a central hub zone and get a satisfying sense of exploration.</br></p>

We last updated this list back in February of 2021, and since then there have been all sorts of new and exciting additions to the genre that have shaken things up. So with that said, let’s take another look at our picks for the 10 best Soulslikes – specifically, the ones that aren’t developed by From Software themselves.
