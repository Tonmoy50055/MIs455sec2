<p>Actually this is a demonstration assignment for my course. This simple project is about showing off my knowledge of HTML, CSS. Though I tried to complete this project according to the recommendation but still I tried to add some tags and some CSS property. I tried to do better in this assignment and hope I will be much better in the next assignment. </p>
